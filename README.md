- Use Typescript syntax
- Allow users to create new instances of a model
- Manage your build tool dependencies with npm
- Manage your front-end dependencies with Bower
- Include a gulp-based asset pipeline with a development server.
- The app should be structured in a logical way, including some SASS and at least 2 JavaScript files.
- Use exports in at least one of your JavaScript files
